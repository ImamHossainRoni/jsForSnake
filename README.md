JavaScript started as a way to make web pages more interactive. Nowadays JavaScript runs in more places than just web browsers â€” it runs on web servers, phones and even robots! 
JavaScript is a programming language or, in other words, a means by which a computer is instructed to do things. Just the same as one controls humans with hisses and meows, one controls computers with statements written in a programming language. All web browsers understand JavaScript and you can take advantage of that to make web pages do crazy things!
